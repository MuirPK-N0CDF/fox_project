# fox_project
The fox project includes the Freecad files and .stl files for several different hidden transmitters intended for use with amateur radio. 
Mechanical drawings of common components, if not readily available, may also be uploaded. Please use FreeCad or openSCAD compatible files for all designs.
If you design a harness for a different radio, microcontroller, or battery, please include the raw cad files, not just the .stl, in your upload.
Wiring diagrams should be provided for the radio.

Also included in the project is the code for the microcontroller used to control the radio. You will need to modify the code to include your callsign before you run the radio. Everybody will laugh at you if you transmit "NOCALL-0" as your callsign.


Current supported controller:
Arduino MKRZERO (for SD & DAC for pre-recorded audio, just to make it more friendly.)
Arduino UNO (I have the code and cad files somewhere. I gotta dig them up. CW only using the PWM hack.)


Current supported Radios:
GT-5R

Current supported battery:
Fuse (plus you) 5000 mAh (MKRZERO model)
Some cheap amazon battery (UNO model)

Plan to add:
Other Arduinos
Yaesu FT-60
DeWalt battery (will need additional hardware for 12/20/60v to 5v and possibly 7.2v outputs)



If you make an improvement to my design or code, share it. If you write code for a different microcontroller, or build a frame for a different radio, let me know or make your own repo. Contact me and I may link it. If you want it added here, I can do that too.

Amateur radio operators and/or clubs: print as many of my devices as you see fit. If you build these devices, please use them. Get the local scouts or a church youth group involved, or start a club at the local high school. Spread the love of radio to your community.

I reserve the rights to sell my own device. I am not working on this project for a living, but I have to offset the cost of development and building somewhat. Especially for the other, much more expensive side of this project.
